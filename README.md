# Tic-Tac-Toe Web App

## Overview

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main objective of this project is to deepen the understanding of prototypal inheritance in JavaScript while practicing styling with SASS. The game features a scoring system, dynamic turn updates, and options to reset or play again after the game ends.


## Features

-   **Interactive Gameplay**: Play Tic-Tac-Toe against another player with a visually appealing interface.
-   **Score Tracking**: Keeps track of each player's wins.
-   **Dynamic Turn Indicator**: The header updates to show whose turn it is.
-   **Reset Functionality**: Reset the game at any time to start fresh.
-   **Play Again Option**: After a game ends, easily start a new game without refreshing the page.
-   **Styled with SASS**: The project is styled using SASS, making the CSS more organized and maintainable.

## Technologies Used

-   **HTML**: For the structure of the web app.
-   **CSS/SASS**: For styling the interface. SASS is used to manage styles more effectively.
-   **JavaScript**: For the game logic, including prototypal inheritance to manage game functions.

## Learning Objectives

-   **Prototypal Inheritance**: Understanding how to use JavaScript's prototypal inheritance to organize and manage the game's logic.
-   **SASS**: Practice using SASS to write more efficient and manageable CSS.
-   **DOM Manipulation**: Dynamically updating the DOM to reflect the current game state, such as updating scores and indicating the current player's turn.

## Future Improvements

-   **AI Opponent**: Implement a computer opponent to play against.
-   **Responsive Design**: Enhance the app for better performance on mobile devices.
-   **Animations**: Add animations for a more engaging user experience.
